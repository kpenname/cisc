- load the page - log in works - enter bob 1234 and bob is logged in

- trying to create a new user does not work

  - The Create an Account part starts with the form in login.hbs.
  - The form action is /addAccount which is supposed to go to accountRoute.js/addAccount
  - In accountRoute, nothing happens
  - I have included this endpoint in the app.js/routes

- don't know where to go with this since it was working before.
